The Game Server Status Add-In was constructed to provide an at a glance status of several of PWE's game servers on the new vanillaforums. Once installed a traffic light panel will be added to the top of the page near the forum search box. Each Game's Initials are displayed together with a status light. A Green light means the game server(s) are online. A Red light means the game server(s) are offline. An Amber light on the main panel indicates that some of the game server(s) are offline. Hovering over each game's initials will display further information on the state of individual server(s) where application, split into east coast, west coast and europe.

The Game Panel adds an easily accessed panel to PWE Vanilla Forums with links to each game's home page, news page and specific game forum. The panel also has permanent links to the ARC Home Page, Charge Page and ARC User Profile. 

Once installed, simply hover mouse over the ARC logo <img src="https://rawgit.com/Eiledon/PWEVC/master/pwevc_gamepanel_icon.jpg"> in the top left corner of your browser window to access the hidden panel. To access the links for a particular game simply hover over that game's logo.

Users can customise which games the panel will show by clicking on the Select "Games button" in the bottom right corner. Then simply untick the games you do not wish to see and click "Select Games" button once more to apply the choices and save the settings. These settings will be remembered between browsing sessions.
